Layout: 
Subsets of our data (<25 MB) are in this repository in the form of CSV files ('epa_EV.csv', 'Parking_violations.csv', 'Airline_delays.csv') they each have corresponding .ipynb files that read in the data and conduct some preliminary ETL and data processing. 
'Updated_Milestone1 Writeup.pdf' is our full writeup due on 10/13/23
'loaded_and_parsed_EV.ipynb' displays tidy data that we were able to load in and process and is then visualized in the 'EV_preprocessing.ipynb' file 
'Milestone 1 Links.pdf' contains the links to our datasets as well as a few others 


Milestone 1 Summary: 
Solar Cells? Parking Tickets? Plane Flights?
My partner, Sean Hall, and I (Juila Baratta) are considering working with one of the three datasets below. Our first data set discusses domestic flight delays from different airports and carriers. Analysis of trends within this data set can help us determine the likelihood that a given flight will be delayed. This data is interesting because flight delay is a very common nuisance in the US. Although it is typically thought of as relatively random by most Americans, the data proves otherwise. We hypothesize that factors such as the type of airline carrier one uses, weather along the route, the season, and the time of the day all affect the probability of a flight being delayed. Analyzing this data set could prove useful for flyers when deciding on important flights.
The second table contains data on the net generation of energy from photovoltaic cells. From this, we can determine which states are producing the most energy via photovoltaics and how that has changed over the years. This data can also be compared to a timeline of important breakthroughs in PVs, funding for clean energy, pricing of raw materials, political affiliation of the region, and weather of the region. 
Our third dataset contains information about parking violations in major cities in North America. From this data, we can determine how variables like location, time of day, and car color and type affect the probability of getting a parking ticket. Analysis of this data can help isolate the intensity with which certain cities enforce parking violations, and even provide recommendations for where to park when all the open spots are taken. This data could be applied further to the creation of an app that will tell a user where to not park based on a dataset of millions of parking violations based on vehicle color and brand, city, and time of day. This dataset could be updated by the user based on their successful and unsuccessful parking experiences. 

Collaboration Plan: 
We are going to set up a GitHub Repository to edit and share code
We will meet once a week on Thursdays from 12:30 pm - 2:00 pm 
We are neighbors so we can meet more frequently if needed.
